# PythonNeuralNetwork
This README file is still under development. In fact, this project is
still ongoing as I learn the fundamentals of ML. For the moment please 
view the Juptyer Notebook ["Simple Neurons.ipynb"](https://github.com/kmiller96/PythonNeuralNetwork/blob/master/Simple%20Neurons.ipynb) to see my 
implementation of backpropogation for an AND and an OR gate. The current
project I'm working on, which contains majority of the information on 
the theory of the project, is about teaching a computer to understand
an XOR gate. You can find details of that in 
["Exploring Neural Networks.ipynb"](https://github.com/kmiller96/PythonNeuralNetwork/blob/master/Exploring%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb).
