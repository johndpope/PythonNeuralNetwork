    "# Simple Neurons: The Basics Of Neural Networks\n",
    "This notebook is where I explore neural networks on a much more basic and fundamental level. Instead of focusing on creating a NN that can solve the universe, I want to fully aquaint myself with the fundamentals of linear algebra in ML, backpropogation and optimisation techniques. That's what this notebook is aimed to do: simply learn the basics in a much more controlled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be using a simple case of three input neurons, _no_ hidden neurons and a single output neuron. I've designed the system this way since I want to attempt to \"learn\" the behaviour of an AND gate and an OR gatye\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
    "Once again, I'm using a plethora of material to learn about NN and how to implement them. In no particular order, here are my main reads that have helped me massively.\n",
